This plugin represents an Engine for a Minecraft server created by NoyHillel.

This Engine includes Minigames such as: SurvivalGames, Battledome and KitPVP.

The "KitPVP" minigame isn't really updated/completed properly.

SurvivalGames and Battledome work well, give it a try!
Most features are configurable to your liking! If not, drop me an email at: info@inscriptio.org and I'll add it for ya!

It also includes a Hub plugin, which can be customised within the config.

Hope this Engine is to your liking!

LICENCE:

This project is open source for a few reasons:

Training Purposes:
- I would like other, newer developers to learn and possibly see how Bukkit can be used to created a back end engine like this for customers, or even their own server.

Employers:
- I would also like for other employers to see the work which I have created, this is my biggest project to date totalling to over 11,000 lines of code!

The Community:
- If you have a passion for Minecraft and servers, feel free to use this on your server. If you have any problems, also feel free to drop me and email and I'll add you on Skype to help resolve aqny issues.

Thanks and Enjoy!
